I'll explain what I did...I tried to clone a repository from GitHub which contains GIT LFS pointers in it. I followed the following steps and got the actual files.

Fork the repo to one of your users
Go to repo settings
Find "Include Git LFS objects in archives" under the Archives section and check it
Go to the Danger Zone section, select "Archive this repository"
Confirm and authorize.
Return to the archived repository.
Download as .zip
Download will pause for a minute or so before it starts downloading lfs objects. Wait and it should continue.
